# Tasks Update Steady Endpoint Benchmark
#
# Tests PUT /tasks/{id} endpoint with low contention single writer pattern
#
# Target API features:
#   - Lens for focused updates
#   - Prism for optional fields
#   - Optional for nullable handling
#   - Bifunctor for error transformation
#
# Purpose: Measure update success rate under low contention conditions
#
# Note: tasks_update.lua assumes 1 thread = 1 connection (single writer per thread).
#       threads and connections must be equal to ensure proper writer isolation.
